- Build Docker image from Dockerfile locally, tag it as `<Your_Docker_Hub_Account_Name>/<Your_Image_Name>:<Tag>` and 
explain steps of building. Note that repo name is the combination of `<Your_Docker_Hub_Account_Name>/<Your_Image_Name>`.

```bash
docker build -t "callahanclarus/flask-app:1.0" .
docker image ls
```

- Run the newly built image as container in detached mode, connect host `port 80` to container `port 80`, and name container as `welcome`. 
Then list running containers and connect to EC2 instance from the browser to show the Flask app is running.

```bash
docker run -d --name welcome -p 80:80 callahanclarus/flask-app:1.0
docker ps
