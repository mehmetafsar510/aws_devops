# Project-503 : Blog Page Application (Django) deployed on AWS Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling, S3, Relational Database Service(RDS), VPC's Components, DynamoDB and Cloudfront with Route 53 (STUDENT_SOLUTION)

## Description

The Clarusway Blog Page Application aims to deploy blog application as a web application written Django Framework on AWS Cloud Infrastructure. This infrastructure has Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling Group of Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Instances and Relational Database Service (RDS) on defined VPC. Also, The Cloudfront and Route 53 services are located in front of the architecture and manage the traffic in secure. User is able to upload pictures and videos on own blog page and these are kept on S3 Bucket. This architecture will be created by Firms DevOps Guy.

## Steps to Solution
  
### Step 1: Create dedicated VPC and whole components
        
    ### VPC
    - Create VPC. 
        create a vpc named `aws_capstone-VPC` CIDR blok is `90.90.0.0/16` 
        no ipv6 CIDR block
        tenancy: default
    - select `aws_capstone-VPC` VPC, click `Actions` and `enable DNS hostnames` for the `aws_capstone-VPC`. 

    ## Subnets
    - Create Subnets
        - Create a public subnet named `aws_capstone-public-subnet-1A` under the vpc aws_capstone-VPC in AZ us-east-1a with 90.90.10.0/24
        - Create a private subnet named `aws_capstone-private-subnet-1A` under the vpc aws_capstone-VPC in AZ us-east-1a with 90.90.11.0/24
        - Create a public subnet named `aws_capstone-public-subnet-1B` under the vpc aws_capstone-VPC in AZ us-east-1b with 90.90.20.0/24
        - Create a private subnet named `aws_capstone-private-subnet-1B` under the vpc aws_capstone-VPC in AZ us-east-1b with 90.90.21.0/24

    - Set `auto-assign IP` up for public subnets. Select each public subnets and click Modify "auto-assign IP settings" and select "Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address" 

    ## Internet Gateway

    - Click Internet gateway section on left hand side. Create an internet gateway named `aws_capstone-IGW` and create.

    - ATTACH the internet gateway `aws_capstone-IGW` to the newly created VPC `aws_capstone-VPC`. Go to VPC and select newly created VPC and click action ---> Attach to VPC ---> Select `aws_capstone-VPC` VPC 

    ## Route Table
    - Go to route tables on left hand side. We have already one route table as main route table. Change it's name as `aws_capstone-public-RT` 
    - Create a route table and give a name as `aws_capstone-private-RT`.
    - Add a rule to `aws_capstone-public-RT` in which destination 0.0.0.0/0 (any network, any host) to target the internet gateway `aws_capstone-IGW` in order to allow access to the internet.
    - Select the private route table, come to the subnet association subsection and add private subnets to this route table. Similarly, we will do it for public route table and public subnets. 
        
    ## Endpoint
    - Go to the endpoint section on the left hand menu
    - select endpoint
    - click create endpoint
    - service name  : `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3`
    - VPC           : `aws_capstone-VPC`
    - Route Table   : private route tables
    - Policy        : `Full Access`
    - Create

### Step 2: Create Security Groups (ALB ---> EC2 ---> RDS)

1. ALB Security Group
Name            : aws_capstone_ALB_Sec_Group
Description     : ALB Security Group allows traffic HTTP and HTTPS ports from anywhere 
Inbound Rules
VPC             : AWS_Capstone_VPC
HTTP(80)    ----> anywhere
HTTPS (443) ----> anywhere

2. EC2 Security Groups
Name            : aws_capstone_EC2_Sec_Group
Description     : EC2 Security Groups only allows traffic coming from aws_capstone_ALB_Sec_Group Security Groups for HTTP and HTTPS ports. In addition, ssh port is allowed from anywhere
VPC             : AWS_Capstone_VPC
Inbound Rules
HTTP(80)    ----> aws_capstone_ALB_Sec_Group
HTTPS (443) ----> aws_capstone_ALB_Sec_Group
ssh         ----> anywhere

3. RDS Security Groups
Name            : aws_capstone_RDS_Sec_Group
Description     : EC2 Security Groups only allows traffic coming from aws_capstone_EC2_Sec_Group Security Groups for MYSQL/Aurora port. 

VPC             : AWS_Capstone_VPC
Inbound Rules
MYSQL/Aurora(3306)  ----> aws_capstone_EC2_Sec_Group

4. NAT Instance Security Group

Description     : ALB Security Group allows traffic HTTP and HTTPS and SSH ports from anywhere 
Inbound Rules
VPC             : AWS_Capstone_VPC
HTTP(80)    ----> anywhere
HTTPS (443) ----> anywhere
SSH (22)    ----> anywhere

### Step 3: Create RDS
First we create a subnet group for our custom VPC. Click `subnet Groups` on the left hand menu and click `create DB Subnet Group` 
```text
Name               : aws_capstone_RDS_Subnet_Group
Description        : aws capstone RDS Subnet Group
VPC                : aws_capstone_VPC

    - Select Backup Window ---> Select 03:00 (am) Duration 1 hour
    - Maintance window : Select window    ---> 04:00(am) Duration:1 hour
create instance
```

### Step 4: Create two S3 Buckets and set one of these as static website.
Go to the S3 Consol and lets create two buckets. 

1. Blog Website's S3 Bucket

- Click Create Bucket
```text
Bucket Name : awscapstones3<YOUR NAME>blog
Region      : N.Virginia
Block all public access : Unchecked
Other Settings are keep them as are
create bucket
```

2. S3 Bucket for failover scenario

- Click Create Bucket
```text
Bucket Name : www.<YOUR DNS NAME>
Region      : N.Virginia
Block all public access : Unchecked
Please keep other settings as are
```
- create bucket

- Selects created `www.<YOUR DNS NAME>` bucket ---> Properties ---> Static website hosting
```text
Static website hosting : Enable
Hosting Type : Host a static website
Index document : index.html
save changes
```
- Select `www.<YOUR DNS NAME>` bucket ---> select Upload and upload `index.html` and `sorry.jpg` files from given folder---> Permissions ---> Grant public-read access ---> Checked warning massage

## Step 5: Copy files downloaded or cloned from `Clarusway_project` repo on Github 

## Step 6: Prepair your Github repository
- Create private project repository on your Github and clone it on your local. Copy all files and folders which are downloaded from clarusway repo under this folder. Commit and push them on your private Git hup Repo.

## Step 7: Prepare a userdata to be utilized in Launch Template
Please 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get update -y
apt-get install git -y
apt-get install python3 -y
cd /home/ubuntu/
TOKEN="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
git clone https://$TOKEN@<YOUR PRIVATE REPO URL>
cd /home/ubuntu/<YOUR PRIVATE REPO NAME>
apt install python3-pip -y
apt-get install python3.7-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev -y
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd /home/ubuntu/<YOUR PRIVATE REPO NAME>/src
python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
```

## Step 8: Write RDS database endpoint and S3 Bucket name in settings file given by Clarusway Fullstack Developer team and push your application into your own public repo on Github
Please follow and apply the instructions in the developer_notes.txt.
```text
- Movie and picture files are kept on S3 bucket named aws_capstone_S3_<name>_Blog as object. You should create an S3 bucket and write name of it on "/src/cblog/settings.py" file as AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME variable. In addition, you must assign region of S3 as AWS_S3_REGION_NAME variable

- Users credentials and blog contents are going to be kept on RDS database. To connect EC2 to RDS, following variables must be assigned on "/src/cblog/settings.py" file after you create RDS;
    a. Database name - "NAME" variable 
    b. Database endpoint - "HOST" variables
    c. Port - "PORT"
    d. PASSWORD variable must be written on "/src/.env" file not to be exposed with settings file
```
- Please check if this userdata is working or not. to do this create new instance in public subnet and show to students that it is working

## Step 9: Create NAT Instance in Public Subnet
To launch NAT instance, go to the EC2 console and click the create button.

```text
write "NAT" into the filter box
select NAT Instance `amzn-ami-vpc-nat-hvm-2018.03.0.20181116-x86_64-ebs` 
Instance Type: t2.micro
Configure Instance Details  
    - Network : aws_capstone_VPC
    - Subnet  : aws_capstone-public-subnet-1A (Please select one of your Public Subnets)
    - Other features keep them as are
Storage ---> Keep it as is
Tags: Key: Name     Value: AWS Capstone NAT Instance
Configure Security Group
    - Select an existing security group: aws_capstone_NAT_Sec_Group
Review and select our own pem key
```

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
- select newly created NAT instance and enable stop source/destination check
- go to private route table and write a rule
```
Destination : 0.0.0.0/0
Target      : instance ---> Select NAT Instance
Save
```

## Step 10: Create Launch Template and IAM role for it
Go to the IAM role console click role on the right hand menu than create role
```text

git clone https://$TOKEN@<YOUR PRIVATE REPO URL>
cd /home/ubuntu/<YOUR PRIVATE REPO NAME>
apt install python3-pip -y
apt-get install python3.7-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev -y
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd /home/ubuntu/<YOUR PRIVATE REPO NAME>/src
python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
```
- create launch template

## Step 11: Create certification for secure connection
Go to the certification manager console and click `request a certificate` button. Select `Request a public certificate`, then `request a certificate` ---> `*.<YOUR DNS NAME>` ---> DNS validation ---> No tag ---> Review ---> click confirm and request button. Then it takes a while to be activated. 

## Step 12: Create ALB and Target Group
Go to the Load Balancer section on the left hand side menu of EC2 console. Click `create Load Balancer` button and select Application Load Balancer

```
- click create

To redirect traffic from HTTP to HTTPS, go to the ALB console and select Listeners sub-section.

```text
select HTTP: 80 rule ---> click edit
- Default action(s)
 - Remove existing rule and create new rule which is
    - Redirect to HTTPS 443
    - Original host, path, query
    - 301 - permanently moved
```
Lets go ahead and look at our ALB DNS --> it going to say "it is not safe", however, it will be fixed after settings of Route 53

## Step 13: Create Autoscaling Group with Launch Template 

Go to the Autoscaling Group on the left hand side menu. Click create Autoscaling group. 

- Choose launch template or configuration
```text

---> First we'll create a primary record for cloudfront

Failover record to add to your DNS ---> Define failover record

Value/Route traffic to  : Alias to cloudfront distribution
                          - Select created cloudfront DNS
Failover record type    : Primary
Health check            : aws capstone health check
Record ID               : Cloudfront as Primary Record
----------------------------------------------------------------

---> Second we'll create secondary record for S3

Failover another record to add to your DNS ---> Define failover record

Value/Route traffic to  : Alias to S3 website endpoint
                          - Select Region
                          - Your created bucket name emerges ---> Select it
Failover record type    : Secondary
Health check            : No health check
Record ID               : S3 Bucket for Secondary record type
```

- click create records

## Step 16: Create DynamoDB Table
Go to the Dynamo Db table and click create table button

- Create DynamoDB table
```text
Name            : awscapstoneDynamo
Primary key     : id
Other Stuff     : Keep them as are
click create
```

## Step 17-18: Create Lambda function

Before we create our Lambda function, we should create IAM role that we'll use for Lambda function. Go to the IAM console and select role on the left hand menu, then create role button
```text
Select Lambda as trusted entity ---> click Next:Permission
Choose: - LambdaS3fullaccess, 
        - Network Administrator
        - DynamoDBFullAccess
No tags
Role Name           : aws_capstone_lambda_Role
Role description    : This role give a permission to lambda to reach S3 and DynamoDB on custom VPC
```

then, go to the Lambda Console and click create function

- Basic Information
```text

Function Name           : awscapsitonelambdafunction
Runtime                 : Python 3.8
Create IAM role         : S3 full access policy

Advance Setting:
Network                 : 
    - VPC               : aws-capstone-VPC
    - Subnets           : Select all subnets
    - Security Group    : Select default security Group
```

- Now we'll go to the S3 bucket belongs our website and create an event to trigger our Lambda function. 

## Step 17-18: Create S3 Event and set it as trigger for Lambda Function

Go to the S3 console and select the S3 bucket named `awscapstonec3<name>blog`.

- Go to the properties menu ---> Go to the Event notifications part

- Click create event notification for creating object
```text
Event Name              : aws capstone S3 event
Prefix                  : media/
Select                  :
    - All object create events
Destination             : Lambda Function
Specify Lambda function : Choose from your Lambda functions 
Lambda funstion         : awscapstonelambdafunction
click save
```text

```
- After create an event go to the `awscapstonelambdafunction` lambda Function and click add trigger on the top left hand side.

- For defining trigger for creating objects
```text
Trigger configuration   : S3
Bucket                  : awscapstonec3<name>blog
Event type              : All object create events
Check the warning message and click add ---> sometimes it says overlapping situation. When it occurs, try refresh page and create a new trigger or remove the s3 event and recreate again. then again create a trigger for lambda function
```

- For defining trigger for deleting objects
```bash

Trigger configuration   : S3
Bucket                  : awscapstonec3<name>blog
Event type              : All object delete events
Check the warning message and click add ---> sometimes it says overlapping situation. When it occurs, try refresh page and create a new trigger or remove the s3 event and recreate again. then again create a trigger for lambda function
```

- Go to the code part and select lambda_function.py ---> remove default code and paste a code on below. If you give DynamoDB a different name, please make sure to change it into the code. 

```python
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client("s3")
    
    if event:
        print("Event: ", event)
        filename = str(event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key'])
        timestamp = str(event['Records'][0]['eventTime'])
