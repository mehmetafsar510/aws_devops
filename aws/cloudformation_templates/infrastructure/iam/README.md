# IAM CloudFormation Templates

## Purpose

IAM Policies for restricting access to AWS resource unless MFA is present. Refer to [How do I use an MFA token to authenticate access to my AWS resources through the AWS CLI?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/)

To generate temporary credentials see the [Generating Temporary Credentials](https://github.com/stelligent/cloudformation_templates/wiki/Generating-Temporary-Credentials) wiki page.

To securely connect to a CodeCommit Repo using MFA, see [Connect Securely to AWS CodeCommit with MFA](https://github.com/stelligent/cloudformation_templates/wiki/Connect-Securely-to-AWS-CodeCommit-with-MFA)
