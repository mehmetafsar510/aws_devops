# Coding Challenge - 013: Compass

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program that finds the direction the compass is pointing to after several rotations.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Implement conditional statements to solva a problem.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Make use of dictionaries to map data.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.

## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes in a list of rotations (left: L and right: R) and a starting direction (North: N, West: W, East: E and South: S) that finds the final direction pointed by the compass after the execution of the rotations.


- Expected Outputs:

```text
final_direction("N", ["L", "L", "L"]) ➞ "E"

final_direction("N", ["R", "R", "R", "L"]) ➞ "S"

final_direction("N", ["R", "R", "R", "R"]) ➞ "N"

final_direction("N", ["R", "L"]) ➞ "N"
```
